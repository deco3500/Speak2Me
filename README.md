# Project Speak2Me by TrashFilter

##Problem:
Presently all news isn't made readily assessable through an audio medium. This presents a problem for the visually impaired, those who don't have time to read and those who don't have the available attention to read through a section of news.    


## Introduction: 
With news transitioning to a digital medium, the majority of news is read or watched from a screen. However, there are many times in daily life where visual information would be distracting or unavailable. This is where radio and podcasts have been successful as an audio medium for distributing information to the masses. This project aims to deliver relevant narrated news articles to those who cannot otherwise read or watch a screen.

## Concept: 
Speak2Me is a project to develop a system of contributors narrating, tagging and uploading news articles for consumption by the main users of the product. There will be a community-driven reputation system in order to maintain the quality of the media. The contributor will choose a news article, narrate it and upload the narration with appropriate tags and a link to the original article. The system will then deliver a curated stream/podcast of news articles to the user who has indicated their interests with appropriate tags. 

### Target users/audience:
  * Car commuters, who wish to consume relevant news but are unable to view a screen.
  * Bus or train commuters, who wish to consume relevant news without the eye-strain or motion sickness usually associated with viewing a screen whilst moving.
  * People walking or travelling, who wish for a quick digest of news but would rather wear headphones and not have their phone out.
  * Anyone who wants a curated stream of news, but are happy to listen to it as opposed to reading or watching it.

### User-story diagram of the proposed solution:
Narrator/contributor side | User side
--- | ---
1. A news article is published. | 1. The user installs the phone app, and performs initial setup.
2. A contributor considers the article newsworthy, and decides to narrate it and upload it to ‘Speak2Me’. | 2. They select their interests, presented in the form of pre-chosen tags.
3. The contributor narrates the article and uploads it to the ‘Speak2Me’ database through a website, providing a link to the source article. | 3. They press play and listen.
4. They select the appropriate tags for the article. | 4. The app, filtering uploaded articles for the user’s tags, plays a stream of recent high-ranking recordings.
5. The article is upvoted by the user, which affects the contributor’s total score (encouraging to upload again or to improve their narration). | 5. The user likes the way the article is narrated, so ‘upvotes’ the article.

### General use cases:
####Listener:
1.As an commuter I would like to be able to listen to the most recent news because it allows me to consume news without distracting me from my commute.

2.As an person who likes to jog, I would like to be able to consume news while I jog, because it spends time by doing both activities together.

3.As a person who is visually impaired I would like to be able to consume the most recent news as it happens with as little effort as possible.

4.As a user who values quality and integity I would like to be able to filter news to my standard of quality.

####Creator:
1.As a news broadcaster I want my news to reach as many people as possible through as many mediums as possible.

## Team: 
### Members of the DECO3500 course, team ‘TrashFilter’:
Aidan Davis  
Diego Robles  
George Williams  
Shelby Pye


### Team responsibilities:
_Team Leader and Manager_ - Aidan Davis  
_Back-end_ - George Williams  
_Design_ - Diego Robles  
_Content_ - Shelby Pye  


### How will decisions be made:
Decisions will be made collectively as a group ensuring every team member’s ideas are taken into account. In case of discrepancies, the decision will be based on a voting system; in the case of a tied vote, we will consult with the tutors or the course coordinator to assist with any problematic decision.

### How will the team handle poor performance and resolve conflicts:
The team will conduct an intervention with the poor performer in order to address their lack of contribution to the group. The remainder of the group will decide if their reason/excuse is legitimate or understandable. If so, the conflict is resolved. If not, the team will reassign the work and course staff will be notified of the incident.

## Communication: 
### Where and when will your team meet and how will you all communicate?
The team will communicate over a private Facebook group and meet during the weekly workshop meeting. Communication with the course will utilise the DECO3500 Slack channel.

### Where will files be stored and shared?
Github will be used as a code repository. Google Drive will be used for all other documents and files. When anything of value is uploaded, the uploader will inform the team using the Facebook group.

### What are the file naming conventions?
Files will be clearly named so that they can give context as to what they are about.

### Identify the social platform/s your team has adopted and explain the choice.
Facebook group messaging, as it easily facilitates group conversations.

### How will it facilitate communication and / or file sharing? 
Files should be uploaded to either the github or the google drive and referenced on the facebook group chat. No files should be placed on the facebook group as they can get lost and forgotten.

## Project Plan: 
### Project phases: 

#### Phase 1: Research
Identify the key audiences and what features they would want to use.  
_Duration: 2 weeks (02/09/19 - 15/09/16)_
##### Key deliverables:
  * identify similar businesses/products and determine features and problems that they came across.

#### Phase 2: Requirements 
Establish the requirements needed for the project and assign to team members.  
_Duration: 1 week (16/09/16 - 22/09/16)_
##### Key deliverables:
  * Use cases(Scoped within the project and out of scope)

#### Phase 3: Design
Design the prototype, trial and error with what can work and what cannot.  
_Duration: 3 weeks (23/09/16 - 13/10/16)_
##### Key deliverables:
  * Backend logic design.
  * User interface design.

#### Phase 4: Build
Build the prototype.  
_Duration: 3-4 weeks (Commencing 14/10/16)_
##### Key deliverables:
  * Functional selection of the order in which to play narrations appropriate to each user.
  * Functional playback of narrations in the correct order.
  * Community voting system operational and influencing the ordering of articles.

Android Developer Studio will be used to develop the application. The Android platform was selected as it is free and provides useful open source libraries.
